# BZINB 

This is a new model called Bivariate Zero-inflated Negative binomial regression model. This model was first proposed by Faroughi, P., & Ismail, N. (2017) and constructed under Sarmanov family of distribution. We derived a score test for zero-inflation, overdispersion, independence, and dependency parameter.
