# GBZINB

This study models overdispersed zero-inflated bivariate coefficient data based on the *bivariate zero-inflated negative binomial (BZINB) regression model first proposed by Faroughi & Ismail (2017). Score tests for zero inflation, overdispersion, independence, and dependence parameters are derived, and the efficiency of the tests is verified through Monte Carlo studies.
